Requirements
------------

This plugin requires the Elggx Userpoints plugin to be installed and enabled.


What this plugin does
---------------------

A user can select (via a dropdown menu selection) how many hours he worked on something and he will then be rewarded with a certain number of userpoints per hour of work.

It's a rather skeletal plugin (e.g. userpoints per hour defined as constant instead of plugin setting, no river entry etc.). I got a request for the underlying feature (input of a period of work and rewarding this work with userpoints) by Aiden and because I have an unfinished other plugin lying around that I was able to use to get the Userpoints balance plugin ready rather quickly I thought of publishing the plugin instead of describing how to implement it only.


Installation
------------

1. If you have a previous version of the Userpoints balance plugin installed, first remove the old plugin folder from your mod directory before copying/extracting the new version to your server,
1. Copy the userpoints_balance plugin folder into you mod folder,
2. Enable the Userpoints balance plugin in the admin section of your site.
